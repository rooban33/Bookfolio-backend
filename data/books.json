The book contains letters the writer intended to write to each of his relatives. I didn’t read all of them — only the ones I felt connected to. The letters to the mother, father, sister, and Periyappa were wonderful. I may reread them again!"

The story was average but not that bad. It was little funny here and there but the final revealing of the murderer was not that satisfying. Once readable!!"
